After adding `lib` files to the Groovy path, script was originally invoked as `NLPADAPT_BROKER_URI="nio://localhost:61616" NLPADAPT_DATASOURCE_URI="jdbc:sqlite:mimic-rtf.db" groovy client.groovy`, where `NLPADAPT_BROKER_URI` is the address of an ActiveMQ instance, and `NLPADAPT_DATASOURCE_URI` is a database specifier (we're using a local sqlite database for testing).
